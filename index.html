            My favorite CMSC subject so far is CMSC 123, because creating algorithms for the data structures felt like doing a puzzle. <br>
            My favorite GE is Ethics 1. It allowed me to further understand myself by knowing how I make moral judgements and why I make it like that. <br>
            My favorite PL would be python because its syntax is very easy. <br>
            My Favorite food (right now) is Pork Liempo.

            My childhood dream was to become rich... looks like it still is <br>
